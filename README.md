# Starbucks Reward Analysis.

## Project Overview
Starbucks as a means of promoting sales and awarding customer loyalty makes offers to their customers which comes in 3 forms; BOGO, discount and informational offers with difficulty and validity periods. 
Their target is to increase sells through the customers purchasing merchandise through means and also reduce economic loss on customers who were already on the verge of making purchase.

## Files
Portfolio.json

Transcript.json - A simulated transaction data.

Profile.json - A database of customers.

## Notebook - Starbucks_Capstone_notebook

My notebook sought to answer the following:

Age demographics of completed offers.

Income demographics of completed offers.

Gender demographics of completed offers.

## Libraries

Numpy: To run numerical calculations.

Pandas: To load the given databases into a dataframe format.

matplotlib.pyplot: To visualize plots mostly in histograms, bar plots and scatter

json: To load json data that we are given

datetime, timedelta: To convert dates in dataframes to date format for easier calculations

Axes3D of mpl_toolkits.mplot3d: To see multidimensional 3D scatter relations

tqdm: To track for loop process state

## Conclusion

The other gender labelled 'O' has incomplete data which results in its analysis being inconclusive.

There is higher number of completed offers for income levels in between $50–70k, especially for female customers.

For income levels below $50,000 male customers make up more of the completed offer compared to female customers.
